# Snake Eater
A snake game written in Python using the Pygame library.


## Installing
Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library
```
pip install --user pygame
```


## Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python main.py
```

The `SPEED_OF_SNAKE` variable in snake.py can be changed to set the difficulty level, the faster, the harder.

The rest of the code is properly commented and self explanatory. Tweaks can be made to change the play style or visuals of the game.
